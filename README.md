# Jaiva!

An esolang of mine which is way better, here is how you do stuff in my lanuage

To make a jaiva file. Create a text file with the _`.jiv`_ or _`.jaiva`_ extension.

## Syntax

All lines end in an exclamation mark! Because why arent you screaming code.

Code blocks start with -> and end in <~.

No types. Fuck types.

### Variables

```jiv
maak a <- 20!
maak var1 <- "string"!
maak var5 <- true!
```

For boolean values you can also use `aowa` and `yebo`, figure out yourselves which one is true and false

#### Arrays

```jiv
maak a <- 20, 23, 56, 324, 354!
```

This piece of code doesnt work.

### Comments

```jiv
@ single line comment
{
    multi line comment
}
```

### Logging

```jiv
kuluma("hello")!
```

This logs to ur console fr fr.

### if Statements

```jiv
if (variable != 100) ->
    kuluma("Variable is not 100")!
<~ mara ->
    kuluma("It's 10")!
<~
```

Simple nothing crazy, until

### For loops

```jiv
colonize i <- 0 | i <= 10 | + ->
    kuluma(addition(arrayVar[i], 10))!
<~
```

### Function Decleraion

```jiv
kwenza addition(param1, param2) ->
    khutla (param1 + param2)!
<~
```
