A functional esoteric programming language made with Java on a random January in 2025. What is the goal? idk.

This is for the most part _supposed_ to be a functional programming language.

Jaiva files end in the _`.jiv`_ or _`.jaiva`_ or _`.jva`_ extension.

# Prerquisuiesdsfb

1. **Get and Install (at least) Java 21**
   yeah this isn't a good start 💀 but this shit is made in java so ye man.
   [Download and install the latest JDK 21](https://jdk.java.net/21)

2. **Set Up Jaiva as a Global Command**  
   Follow the instructions in [Install.md](docs/Install.md) to configure Jaiva so you can run the `jaiva` command from anywhere on your system.

3. **CLI**
   The basic command to run your file is `jaiva <filePath>` but [CLI.md](docs/CLI.md) exists for more info.
