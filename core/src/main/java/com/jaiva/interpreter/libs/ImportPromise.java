/**
 * Why is this a record? To be explicit of course.
 * <p>
 *     An Import Promise, is basically a deferred import, in that when  {@link BaseLibrary#instantiate(Class, IConfig, Globals)}
 *     encounters a {@link BaseLibrary} with {@link Exports} annotation, instead of resolving the graph immediately, it creates
 *     a "promise" to resolve the import when {@link BaseLibrary#getVfs(IConfig, Globals)} is called instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     This just pushes away logic, in the sense that:
 *     <ol>
 *         <ul>
 *             For tooling purposes, we only care about {@link LibrarySymbol} or alike, if {@link BaseLibrary#instantiate(Class, IConfig, Globals)}
 *             was eager, we would have no way to differentiate which symbols came from something else for tooling such as
 *             markdown output, however
 *         </ul>
 *         <ul>
 *             For actual interpreter purposes, it cares about {@link Vfs} which is inherently, everything this library has
 *             even the exports, this is for things such as making a new scope and a library was imported, or even the only
 *             tool that wants everything this library offers, the JSON output.
 *         </ul>
 *     </ol>
