## Functions

### getVarClass

This symbol can be reached by the following aliases: _`getVarClass`_

_**Attempts to return the symbol's corresponding Java class in string form. If you're using this then you def don't know what you're doing.**_


#### Definition

```jaiva
F~getVarClass(var)
```
- **_var_**  **`<-`** _**idk**_
	 - _The value to return it's token symbol for_

_**Returns:**_ **The .toString() class representation of the given variable's token**

Since Version: _1.0.0-beta.0_


#### Example: 

```jaiva
maak name <- "ayo!"!
khuluma(getVarClass(name))! @ Prints com.jaiva.tokenizer.tokens.Token$TStringVar@(hashcode)
khuluma(getVarClass(reservedKeywords))! @ Prints com.jaiva.tokenizer.tokens.Token$TArrayVar@(hashcode)
```

### flat

This symbol can be reached by the following aliases: _`flat`_

_**Attempts to flatten (at the top level) the given arrays array1 and array2 into 1 single array.**_


#### Definition

```jaiva
F~flat(<-arrays?)
```
- **_arrays_** **`?`** **`<-`** _**[]**_
	 - _Variable amount of arrays to input_

> [!NOTE]
> _If there are any type mismatches in array1, it will be ignored and the same check is done to array2 and so on. Therefore this function will **always** return an array, whether or not it was successful._


Since Version: _1.0.0-beta.2_


#### Example: 

```jaiva
maak array1 <-| 1, 2, 3!
maak array2 <-| 4, 5, 6!
maak array3 <- flat(array1, array2)! @ Flattens the two arrays into a new one.
khuluma(array3)! @ Prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```


---


### sleep

This symbol can be reached by the following aliases: _`sleep`_

_**Pause execution of the interpreter for n amount of milliseconds.**_


#### Definition

```jaiva
F~sleep(milliseconds)
```
- **_milliseconds_**  **`<-`** _**number**_
	 - _The amount of milliseconds to sleep for_

> [!NOTE]
> _(Keep in mind this function still has to take your value and turn it into a Java primitive and other things, so the delay might not be exact. If you're looking for accuracy maybe remove x amount of ms till it's accurate.)_


Since Version: _1.0.0_


#### Example: 

```jaiva
khuluma("yo")!
sleep(1000)! @ pause for 1 second.
khuluma("yo.. again")!

### arrLit

This symbol can be reached by the following aliases: _`arrLit`_

_**Creates an array literal from the given elements. This is useful if you want to createFunction an array without declaring it to a variable. For example, `arrLit(1, 2, 3)` will return `[1, 2, 3]`. This is needed as Jaiva doesnt have square bracket syntax**_


#### Definition

```jaiva
F~arrLit(<-elements?)
```
- **_elements_** **`?`** **`<-`** _**[]**_
	 - _Variable amount of elements to take in and turn into a single array._

_**Returns:**_ **The input given, as an array**

Since Version: _3.0.0_


#### Example: 

```jaiva
maak array1 <- arrLit(1, 2, 3, "hello", aowa, idk)! @ Creates an array with mixed types.
maak array2 <-| 1, 2, 3, "hello", aowa, idk! @ Creates an array with mixed types. (Same as above but with maak syntax)
maak array3 <- arrLit()! @ Creates an empty array.
khuluma(array1)! @ Prints [1, 2, 3, "hello", aowa, idk]
khuluma(array3)! @ Prints []
khuluma(array1 = array2)! @ Prints aowa (false) (I am not implementing array equality via `=` operator anytime soon. It is the exact same array though.)
```

### scope

This symbol can be reached by the following aliases: _`scope`_


#### Definition

```jaiva
F~scope(<-string?)
```
- **_string_** **`?`** **`<-`** _**[]**_
	 - _variable amount of strings to input._

_**Returns:**_ **idk**

> [!NOTE]
> _The following are accepted strings: 
    "sw" to suppress all warnings. 
    "ew" to elevate all warnings. 
    "constant" to make all symbols given constant. and 
    "strict" which toggles "ew" and "constant"

```jaiva
scope("freezeAll")!
kwenza af(a) ->

@ Or

scope("ew")!
@* depr $> This fucntion is deprecated.
