    This file only serves the purpose to make sure the
    fscb bug is fixed competely.

    Essentially, if a block of code contained single line comment(s),
    the tokens within the block would be (n amount of single line comments)
    behind the actual line number.

    Where if you had say a variable on line 2, with a single line comment preceeding that variable
    (keep in mind it has to be in blocks). That variable would be misinterpreted as being on line 1.

    This file is purely a Tokenizer test, so it won't be within the Interpreter Testing file.
}

if (a = 10) ->
    @ Single line comment. If the bug is present, the following line is line 16 according to the tokenizer
    maak a <- 10!

    @ Another comment, Again the following line is on line 18 (as 2 single line comments preceed it.
    maak b <- 100!

    @ The correct code is a is on line 17 and b is on line 20.
