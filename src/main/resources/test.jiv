@ The following is code that WOULD be cool to add, but a pain, its essentially 2 for loops running in parallel
@ colonize i, j <- 0 | i >= 10, j <= -10 | +- ->
@     left ->
@     @ some code that uses the variable i
@     @ i will be incremented
@     <~
@     right ->
@     @ some code that uses the variable j
@     @ j will be decremented
